Placing original work authors here for the time being until I find a better way to provide credit. I will most probably include a link on the footer of the page next to a disclaimer, e.g. Disclaimer | Credits | FAQ that will appear as a react-bootstrap modal, where Credits option shows what I've used that isn't mine, and the original author rather than having it buried somewhere, like this text file.
